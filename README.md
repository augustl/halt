# HALT

HALT is an operating system research project.

## Can I use HALT?

It's nowhere near finished. I'm still figuring out the basics of how to boot a PC. I've never made an operating system or even a virtual machine or programming language.

## Why does this repo have so many stars?

I wrote [a blog post](http://augustl.com/blog/2014/an_immutable_operating_system/) about HALT that someone [submitted to Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7166173). The idea of HALT seemed to resonate with a lot of people!
