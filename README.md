# HALT

HALT is an operating system research project.

## Can I use HALT?

It's nowhere near finished. I'm still figuring out the basics of how to boot a PC. I've never made an operating system or even a virtual machine or programming language.

## Why does this repo have so many stars?

I wrote [a blog post](http://augustl.com/blog/2014/an_immutable_operating_system/) about HALT that someone [submitted to Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7166173). The idea of HALT seemed to resonate with a lot of people!

## What is HALT?

What would an operating system look like if everything was immutable?

See this blog post for a conceptual overview: http://augustl.com/blog/2014/an_immutable_operating_system/

## Not UNIX

Halt is not UNIX. The goal is to create something completely new. See the blog post :)
