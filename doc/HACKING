# Hacking on HALT

You need GCC for i686-elf. As in, `gcc -v` needs to say "Target: i686-elf", not "Target: x86_64-linux-gnu" or whatever. I use ansible to compile a GCC for that target, you might find these scripts useful for your own compilation.

# Qemu

I test and run the os in qemu. You need qemu-system-i386 which should come by default with most qemu packages.

Build with sh script/build.sh. This creates the file `target/halt_multiboot.bin`. Use qemu's multiboot facilities to boot the OS.
