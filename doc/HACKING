# Hacking on HALT

You can use the makefile to set up the base images needed for emulation.

    make vboximage

This creates a .img and a .vdi. If the .img exists, the .vdi will be recreated. To mount it up as a loopback device, run

    make mount

This mounts up the .img as loop in PROJECT_ROOT/mnt, meaning writing to that dir updates the .img directly. This makes it easy to deploy new builds of the kernel to the disk.

Create a Virtualbox VM that has uefi enabled and boot from the .vdi disk created by the makefile.

## Qemu

In order to run the image with Qemu, use http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=OVMF. Rename OVMF.fd to bios.bin, and CirrusLogic5446.rom to vgabios-cirrus.bin. Put them both in qemu-bios.

Run with

    make qemu

## GCC

There is a gotcha. You need gcc >= 4.7, otherwise the `-DGNU_EFI_USE_MS_ABI` flag won't work and the calls to BootServices will end up with errors.
